* Description
Makes datasets included with the R language distribution available as clml datasets.
R datasets are obtained csv files on Vincent Centarel's github repository.

Because type information is not included it may be necessary to provide a type specification
for the columns in the csv file.

* Other uses
This package can also be used as a tool for sharing or distributing bundles of datasets.
To do this a csv file which provides the directory of data sets must be made availabe
via a URL. The csv file MUST comply to the following format:
A header with following collumns
  - Package : package 
  - Item    : dataset name
  - Title   : Brief Description of dataset
  - csv     : URL where dataset is available
  - doc     : URL with documentation describing the dataset

The the contents of the file pointed to by doc ~doc~ can be plaintext of HTML.
If it is HTML the HTML tags will be stripped and what ever whitespace formatting will
be used. This field can be empty however the ~inventory~ method will be un available if it is
